This software implements fast and guaranteed floating point geometric predicates,
including novel indirect predicates as described in the following article:

M. Attene. Indirect Predicates for Geometric Constructions. In Elsevier Computer-Aided Design (2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cad.2020.102856).

-------------------
System Requirements
--------------------

The software has been tested on 64 bit PCs running:
 - Microsoft Windows OS with MSVC
 - Linux with standard gcc/g++ development environment
 - Mac OSX with CLANG.

---------------------
Usage
---------------------

The repository provides a header-only C++ library.
To use in your code:
1) Add the "Indirect_Predicates-master/include" path to the list of paths where your compiler searches header files
2) Include "implicit_point.h" in your code 
3) ALWAYS tell your compiler to use the following directives:<br>
   MSVC: /fp:strict /Oi /STACK:8421376 /D _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS<br>
   GCC/G++/CLANG: -frounding-math -O2 -Wl,-z,stacksize=8421376<br>
4) Tell your compiler whether your CPU supports SSE2/AVX2 instructions<br>
   MSVC: /arch:SSE2 or /arch:AVX2<br>
   GCC/G++/CLANG: -msse2 or -mavx2<br>
   
As an example, check the CMakeLists.txt provided to compile the test.cpp code.
